# neverlose-workshop-lua-dumper
This was supposed to be a private project before someone leaked it...

## Lua Dumper Usage: 
load the lua that you want to "borrow",
load the dumper lua,
unload the lua that you want to "borrow",
load the lua that you want to "borrow",
unload the lua that you want to "borrow",
unload the dumper lua,
**SHUTDOWN CSGO IMMEDIATELY**,

dumped lua is located @ [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\UwU.lulz](C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\UwU.lulz)

it contains more than just the lua itself, the beginning is the neverlose internal lua which gets loaded along with every loaded script, and then the actual lua that is getting loaded (closed source scripts are compiled to ljbc while open sourced scripts are in plain text), plus the strings that were passed into the lua loadstring() function, so depending on which lua you are trying to "borrow", it may contain more than just one ljbc/lua, you need to separate them and decompile them yourself

## Dll dumper Usage:
load the lua
find the neverlose located @ [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\cooldump_0xCAFEBABE.bin](C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\cooldump_0xCAFEBABE.bin)
